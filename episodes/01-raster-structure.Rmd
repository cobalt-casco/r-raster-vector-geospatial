## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software,
data, and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this episode, we will introduce the fundamental principles, packages and
metadata/raster attributes that are needed to work with raster data in R. We will
discuss some of the core metadata elements that we need to understand to work with
rasters in R, including CRS and resolution. We will also explore missing and bad
data values as stored in a raster and how R handles these elements.

We will continue to work with the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages that were introduced
in the [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://cobalt-casco.github.io/r-intro-geospatial/) 
lesson. We will use two additional packages in this episode to work with raster 
data - the `terra` and `sf` packages. Make sure that you have these packages 
loaded.

```{r load-libraries-2, eval=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyterra)
library(dplyr)

## Introduce the Data

If not already discussed, introduce the datasets that will be used in this
lesson. A brief introduction to the datasets can be found on the
[Geospatial workshop homepage](https://cobalt-casco.github.io/geospatial-workshop/#data).

For more detailed information about the datasets, check
out the [Geospatial workshop data
page](https://cobalt-casco.github.io/geospatial-workshop/data/).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## View Raster File Attributes

We will be working with a series of GeoTIFF files in this lesson. The
GeoTIFF format contains a set of embedded tags with metadata about the raster
data. We can use the function `describe()` to get information about our raster
data before we read that data into R. It is ideal to do this before importing
your data.

```{r view-attributes-gdal}
describe("data/landsat_casco/b10_cropped/LC09_L2SP_011030_20230920_20230922_02_T1_ST_B10.TIF")
```

If you wish to store this information in R, you can do the following:

```{r}
casco_b10_2023_info <- capture.output(
  describe("data/landsat_casco/b10_cropped/LC09_L2SP_011030_20230920_20230922_02_T1_ST_B10.TIF")
)
```

Each line of text that was printed to the console is now stored as an element of
the character vector `casco_b10_2023_info`. We will be exploring this data throughout this
episode. By the end of this episode, you will be able to explain and understand the output above.

## Open a Raster in R

Now that we've previewed the metadata for our GeoTIFF, let's import this
raster dataset into R and explore its metadata more closely. We can use the `rast()`
function to open a raster in R.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Data Tip - Object names

To improve code
readability, file and object names should be used that make it clear what is in
the file. The data for this episode were collected from Harvard Forest so
we'll use a naming convention of `datatype_casco_2023`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First we will load our raster file into R and view the data structure.

```{r}
b10_casco_2023 <-
  rast("data/landsat_casco/b10_cropped/LC09_L2SP_011030_20230920_20230922_02_T1_ST_B10.TIF")

b10_casco_2023
```

The information above includes a report of min and max values, but no other data
range statistics. Similar to other R data structures like vectors and data frame
columns, descriptive statistics for raster data can be retrieved like

```{r}
summary(b10_casco_2023)
```

but note the warning - unless you force R to calculate these statistics using
every cell in the raster, it will take a random sample of 100,000 cells and
calculate from that instead. To force calculation all the values, you can use 
the function `values`:

```{r}
summary(values(b10_casco_2023))
```

To visualise this data in R using `ggplot2`, we have two options. First, We can convert it to a
dataframe. We learned about dataframes in [an earlier
lesson](https://cobalt-casco.github.io/r-intro-geospatial/04-data-structures-part2/index.html).
The `terra` package has an built-in function for conversion to a plotable dataframe.

```{r}
b10_casco_2023_df <- as.data.frame(b10_casco_2023, xy = TRUE)
```

Now when we view the structure of our data, we will see a standard
dataframe format.

```{r}
str(b10_casco_2023_df)
```

We can use `ggplot()` to plot this data. We will set the color scale to 
`scale_fill_viridis_c` which is a color-blindness friendly color scale. We will 
also use the `coord_quickmap()` function to use an approximate Mercator 
projection for our plots. This approximation is suitable for small areas that 
are not too close to the poles. Other coordinate systems are available in 
ggplot2 if needed, you can learn about them at their help page `?coord_map`.

```{r ggplot-raster, fig.cap="Raster plot with ggplot2 using the viridis color scale"}

ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = b10_casco_2023_df, 
                aes(x = x, y = y, 
                    fill = SST_F_20230920)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +
    coord_quickmap()
```

This is somewhat tedious. With the `tidyterra` package we have another geom - `geom_spatraster` that deals with rasters loaded by `terra`. Also, as land is NA in this data, it will plot it quite nicely by default. We'll also use `coord_sf()`

```{r ggplot-raster-tidyterra, fig.cap="Raster plot with ggplot2 using the viridis color scale"}

ggplot() +
    geom_spatraster(data = b10_casco_2023, 
                    aes(fill = SST_F_20230920)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() 
```


This looks great, and is now on the lat/long scale: CRS 4326. That's because spatial data is always plotted using the `coord_sf()` coordinate system which defaults to 4326. If we want to show things in another projection, or use the original one, we have to set a `datum` argument.

```{r ggplot-raster-tidyterra-crs, fig.cap="Raster plot with ggplot2 using the viridis color scale on the original CRS"}

ggplot() +
    geom_spatraster(data = b10_casco_2023, 
                    aes(fill = SST_F_20230920)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  coord_sf(datum = crs(b10_casco_2023, proj = TRUE))
```

This map shows the sea surface temperature of our Casco Bay at one point in 
time in 2023. We can see that the maximum temperature is 80. While intuitively we 
know this is Farenheit (80C would be.... something), we don't know for sure. We
can look at the metadata of our object to see what the units are. Much of the
metadata that we're interested in is part of the CRS. We introduced the
concept of a CRS in [an earlier
lesson](https://cobalt-casco.github.io/organization-geospatial/03-crs).

Now we will see how features of the CRS appear in our data file and what
meanings they have.

### View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in R

We can view the CRS string associated with our R object using the`crs()`
function.

```{r view-resolution-units}
crs(b10_casco_2023, proj = TRUE)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge

What units are our data in?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

`+units=m` tells us that our data is in meters.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Understanding CRS in Proj4 Format

The CRS for our data is given to us by R in `proj4` format. Let's break down
the pieces of `proj4` string. The string contains all of the individual CRS
elements that R or another GIS might need. Each element is specified with a
`+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by a `,`. After
each `+` we see the CRS element being defined. For example projection (`proj=`)
and datum (`datum=`).

### UTM Proj4 String

A projection string (like the one of `b10_casco_2023`) specifies the UTM projection 
as follows:

`+proj=utm +zone=19 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`

- **proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
- **zone=19:** the zone is 19
- **datum=WGS84:** the datum is WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
  the coordinate system used in the projection)
- **units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in meters


Note that the zone is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRSs will have a
zone. Image source: Chrismurf at English Wikipedia, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#/media/File:Utm-zones-USA.svg) (CC-BY).

## Calculate Raster Min and Max Values

It is useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. In this
case, given we are working with temperature data, these values represent the
min/max sea surface temperature range in Casco Bay.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a GeoTIFF for us. We
can view these values:

```{r view-min-max}
minmax(b10_casco_2023)

min(values(b10_casco_2023), na.rm = TRUE)

max(values(b10_casco_2023), na.rm = TRUE)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Data Tip - Set min and max values

If the minimum and maximum values haven't already been
calculated, we can calculate them using the
`setMinMax()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
b10_casco_2023 <- setMinMax(b10_casco_2023)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We can see that the temperature at our site ranges from ~47F to ~80F.

## Raster Bands

The Sea Surface Temperature object (`b10_casco_2023`) that we've been working with is a
single band raster. This means that there is only one data set stored in the
raster: SST at one time point.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/single_multi_raster.png){alt='Multi-band raster image'}

A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the `rast()`
function to import one single band from a single or multi-band raster. We can
view the number of bands in a raster using the `nlyr()` function.

```{r view-raster-bands}
nlyr(b10_casco_2023)
```

However, raster data can also be multi-band, meaning that one raster file
contains data for more than one variable or time period for each cell. By
default the `raster()` function only imports the first band in a raster
regardless of whether it has one or more bands. Jump to a later episode in
this series for information on working with multi-band rasters:
[Work with Multi-band Rasters in R](05-raster-multi-band-in-r/).


## Bad Data Values in Rasters

Sometimes your rasters can have bad data values. These are different from `NoData Value`s, which get represented by NAs. Bad data values are values
that fall outside of the applicable range of a dataset.

Examples of Bad Data Values:

- The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a measure of
  greenness, has a valid range of -1 to 1. Any value outside of that range would
  be considered a "bad" or miscalculated value.
- Reflectance data in an image will often range from 0-1 or 0-10,000 depending
  upon how the data are scaled. Thus a value greater than 1 or greater than 10,000
  is likely caused by an error in either data collection or processing.  
- Coastal ocean data could be contaminated by measurements from land.

### Find Bad Data Values

Sometimes a raster's metadata will tell us the range of expected values for a
raster. Values outside of this range are suspect and we need to consider that
when we analyze the data. Sometimes, we need to use some common sense and
scientific insight as we examine the data - just as we would for field data to
identify questionable values.

Plotting data with appropriate highlighting can help reveal patterns in bad
values and may suggest a solution. For example, let's look at the range of our SST raster.

```{r raster-range}
minmax(b10_casco_2023)
```

47F seems reasonable, but 80? Maybe it is. But maybe it's just land values that bled over. Let's assume 75F is the real maximum. To view where we might have bad data, we can use `classify()` which takes a matrix with three columns. The first is a low value. The second is a high value. And the third is how we want that classified. Let's say we wanted to look at bad values in our SST dataset.

```{r demo-bad-data-highlighting, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Raster plot showing location of extreme values"}

# reclassify raster to ok/not ok
range_matrix <- matrix(c(
  40,75, 1, #low, high, make a 1
  75, 90, 2
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

b10_highvals <- classify(b10_casco_2023,
                         rcl = range_matrix)

plot(b10_highvals)
```

Yeah, it's some spots at the tail-end of the coast that could indeed by pixels contaminated by land. To fix that, we can set values outside of our range to NA using `clamp()`

```{r clamp}
b10_casco_2023 <- clamp(b10_casco_2023, 
                        lower = 40,
                        upper = 75)

minmax(b10_casco_2023)
```

## Create A Histogram of Raster Values

We can explore the distribution of values contained within our raster using the
`geom_histogram()` function which produces a histogram. Histograms are often
useful in identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data.

```{r view-raster-histogram}

ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = b10_casco_2023_df, 
                   mapping = aes(x = SST_F_20230920))

```

Notice that a warning message is thrown when R creates the histogram.

`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

This warning is caused by a default setting in `geom_histogram` enforcing that there are
30 bins for the data. We can define the number of bins we want in the histogram
by using the `bins` value in the `geom_histogram()` function.

```{r view-raster-histogram2}
ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = b10_casco_2023_df, 
                   mapping = aes(x = SST_F_20230920),
                   bins = 100)

```

Note that the shape of this histogram looks similar to the previous one that
was created using the default of 30 bins. The distribution of SST values looks reasonable. Although, we can see some very thin tails that we might want to inspect to see if they are real values or bad data.

## Challenge: Explore Raster Metadata

Use `describe()` to determine the following about the `data/landsat_casco/b10_cropped/LC08_L2SP_011030_20130815_20200912_02_T1_ST_B10.TIF` file:

1. Does this file have the same CRS as `b10_casco_2023_df`?
2. What is the `NoData Value`?
3. What is resolution of the raster data?
4. How large would a 5x5 pixel area be on the Earth's surface?
5. Is the file a multi- or single-band raster?

```


1. If this file has the same CRS as DSM_HARV?  Yes: UTM Zone 19, WGS84, meters.
2. What format `NoData Values` take?  0
3. The resolution of the raster data? 1x1
4. How large a 5x5 pixel area would be? 5mx5m How? We are given resolution of 1x1 and units in meters, therefore resolution of 5x5 means 5x5m.
