## Load Libraries

This episode explains how to crop a raster using the extent of a vector
layer. We will also cover how to extract values from a raster that occur
within a set of polygons, or in a buffer (surrounding) region around a set of
points.

## Crop a Raster to Vector Extent

We often work with spatial layers that have different spatial extents. The
spatial extent of a vector layer or R spatial object represents the geographic
"edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and west. Thus it
represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

The graphic below illustrates the extent of several of the spatial layers that
we have worked with in this workshop and one new one:

- Area of interest (AOI) -- blue
- Seagrass Beds -- purple
- Areas surveyed for kelp and urchins (marked with white dots)-- black
- Water turbidity in GeoTIFF format -- green

```{r view-extents, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
# Casco AOI
aoi_boundary_casco <- st_read(
  "data/maine_gov_maps/casco_aoi/casco_bay_aoi.shp")

# seagrass in 2022
seagrass_casco_2022 <- st_read(
  "data/maine_gov_seagrass/MaineDEP_Casco_Bay_Seagrass_2022/MaineDEP_Casco_Bay_Seagrass_2022.shp")

# subtidal samples
dmr_casco <- 
  read.csv("data/maine_dmr/casco_kelp_urchin.csv") |>
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# turbidity from modis
turbidity_modis <- rast("data/modis/GIOVANNI-g4.timeAvgMap.MODISA_L3m_KD_Mo_4km_R2022_0_Kd_490.20230701-20230930.71W_42N_66W_45N.tif")
```

```{r compare-data-extents, echo=FALSE}
# code not shown, for demonstration purposes only
modis_aoi <- ext(turbidity_modis) |> as.vector() |> 
  st_bbox() |>st_as_sfc() |> st_set_crs(4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_convex_hull(st_union(modis_aoi)), fill = "lightgreen") +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_casco, fill = "lightblue") +
  geom_sf(data = st_convex_hull(st_union(seagrass_casco_2022)),
          fill = "purple", alpha =  0.2) +
  geom_sf(data = seagrass_casco_2022, size = 2, color = "black") +
  geom_sf(data = st_convex_hull(st_union(dmr_casco)),
          fill = "black", alpha = 0.4) +
#  geom_sf(data = dmr_casco, color = "white", size = 0.2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_sf() + theme_classic()

```

Frequent use cases of cropping a raster file include reducing file size and
creating maps. Sometimes we have a raster file that is much larger than our
study area or area of interest. It is often more efficient to crop the raster
to the extent of our study area to reduce file sizes as we process our data.
Cropping a raster can also be useful when creating pretty maps so that the
raster layer matches the extent of the desired vector layers.

## Crop a Raster Using Vector Extent

We can use the `crop()` function to crop a raster to the extent of another
spatial object. To do this, we need to specify the raster to be cropped and the
spatial object that will be used to crop the raster. R will use the `extent` of
the spatial object as the cropping boundary.

To illustrate this, we will crop the MODIS turbidity data to only include
the area of interest (AOI). Let's start by plotting the full extent of the CHM
data and overlay where the AOI falls within it. The boundaries of the AOI will
be colored blue, and we use `fill = NA` to make the area transparent.

```{r crop-by-vector-extent}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = turbidity_modis) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Turbidity Score", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_casco, color = "blue", fill = NA) +
  coord_sf()
```

Now that we have visualized the area of the turbidity data we want to subset, we can
perform the cropping operation. We are going to `crop()` function from the
raster package to create a new object with only the portion of the MODIS data
that falls within the boundaries of the AOI.

```{r}
turbidity_casco <- crop(x = turbidity_modis, y = aoi_boundary_casco)
```

Now we can plot the cropped MODIS data, along with a boundary box showing the
full MODIS extent. However, remember, since this is raster data, we need to
convert to a data frame in order to plot using `ggplot`. To get the boundary
box from MODIS, the `st_bbox()` will extract the 4 corners of the rectangle that
encompass all the features contained in this object. The `st_as_sfc()` converts
these 4 coordinates into a polygon that we can plot:

```{r show-cropped-area}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sfc(st_bbox(turbidity_modis)), fill = "green",
          color = "green", alpha = .2) +
  geom_spatraster(data = turbidity_casco) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Turbidity Score", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  coord_sf()
```

The plot above shows that the full MODS extent (plotted in green) is much larger
than the resulting cropped raster. Our new cropped MODS now has the same extent
as the `aoi_boundary_casco` object that was used as a crop extent (blue border
below).

```{r view-crop-extent}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = turbidity_casco) +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_casco, color = "blue", fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Turbidity Score", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  coord_sf()
```

We can look at the extent of all of our other objects for this field site.

```{r view-extent}
st_bbox(turbidity_modis)
st_bbox(turbidity_casco)
st_bbox(aoi_boundary_casco)
st_bbox(seagrass_casco_2022)
st_bbox(dmr_casco)
```

Our `dmr_casco` location extent is not the largest It would be nice to see our vegetation plot locations plotted on top of the turbidity information.

## Challenge: Crop to Vector Points Extent

1. Crop the MODIS turbidity data to the extent of the study plot locations.
2. Plot the DMR site location points on top of the turbidity data.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

```{r challenge-code-crop-raster-points}
turbidity_dmr_sites <- crop(x = turbidity_modis, y = dmr_casco)

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = turbidity_dmr_sites) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  geom_sf(data = dmr_casco) 
```

In the plot above, created in the challenge, all the site locations
(black dots) appear on the turbidity raster layer except for a few. some
are situated on the blank space to the left of the map. Why?

The raster data is in a resolution such that many of the coastal pixels are
eliminated as not valid data. Check the resolution of the raster. It's 0.417 
degrees. 1 degree is ~ 111,111 meters. So, 1 pixel here is ~ 4,600 meters, or 
4.6km. We are going to lose a lot of things close to the coast.

Thinking about data source resolution is key in thinking about rasters when
you want to get data close to the coast versus more offshore.

## Extract Raster Pixels Values Using Vector Polygons

Often we want to extract values from a raster layer for particular locations -
for example, plot locations that we are sampling on the ground. We can extract
all pixel values within 20m of our x,y point of interest. These can then be
summarized into some value of interest (e.g. mean, maximum, total).

![](fig//BufferSquare.png){alt='Image shows raster information extraction using 20m polygon boundary.'}
Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

To do this in R, we use the `extract()` function. The `extract()` function
requires:

- The raster that we wish to extract values from,
- The vector layer containing the polygons that we wish to use as a boundary or
  boundaries,
- we can tell it to store the output values in a data frame using
  `raw = FALSE` (this is optional).

We will begin by extracting all canopy height pixel values located within our
`aoi_boundary_casco` polygon which surrounds the tower located at the NEON
Harvard Forest field site.

```{r extract-from-raster}
names(turbidity_casco) <- "turbidity"

turbidity_df <- extract(x = turbidity_casco, 
                     y = aoi_boundary_casco, 
                     raw = FALSE)

str(turbidity_df)
```

When we use the `extract()` function, R extracts the value for each pixel
located within the boundary of the polygon being used to perform the extraction
- in this case the `aoi_boundary_casco` object (a single polygon). Here, the
function extracted values from 90 pixels.

We can create a histogram of turbidity values within the boundary to better
understand the structure or height distribution of turbidity at our site. We will
use the column `turbidity` from our data frame as our x values.

```{r view-extract-histogram}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = turbidity_df, aes(x = turbidity)) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of turbidity values") +
  xlab("turbidity") +
  ylab("Frequency of Pixels")
```

We can also use the `summary()` function to view descriptive statistics
including min, max, and mean height values. These values help us better
understand vegetation at our field site.

```{r}
summary(turbidity_df$turbidity)
```

## Summarize Extracted Raster Values

We often want to extract summary values from a raster. We can tell R the type
of summary statistic we are interested in using the `fun =` argument. Let's
extract a mean height value for our AOI.

```{r summarize-extract}
mean_turbidity_aoi <- extract(x = turbidity_casco, 
                                 y = aoi_boundary_casco, 
                                fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_turbidity_aoi
```

It appears that the mean height value, extracted from our LiDAR data derived
canopy height model is 22.43 meters.

## Extract Data using x,y Locations

We can also extract pixel values from a raster by defining a buffer or area
surrounding individual point locations using the `st_buffer()` function. To do
this we define the summary argument (`fun = mean`) and the buffer distance
(`dist = 20`) which represents the radius of a circular region around each
point. By default, the units of the buffer are the same units as the data's
CRS. All pixels that are touched by the buffer region are included in the
extract.

![](fig/BufferCircular.png){alt='Image shows raster information extraction using 20m buffer region.'}
Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

Let's put this into practice by figuring out the mean tree height in the 20m
around the tower location (`point_HARV`).

```{r extract-point-to-buffer}
mean_turbidity_sites <- extract(x = turbidity_casco,
                                  y = st_buffer(dmr_casco, dist = 20),
                                  fun = mean,
                                raw = FALSE)

hist(mean_turbidity_sites$turbidity)
```

## Challenge: Extract Temperature Values For Seagrass Beds

You can also extract data from polygons. Let's look at temperature in seagrass
beds in 2022.

1) Load up "data/landsat_casco/b10_cropped/LC08_L2SP_011030_20220909_20220914_02_T1_ST_B10.TIF". Reproject it and crop it to the extent of `seagrass_casco_2022` - 
smaller rasters = faster extraction.

2) Extract the average SST in each bed. `cbind()` it back to 
`seagrass_casco_2022` 

3) Plot SST by Hectares of seagrass bed.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1. We can do this as a processing chain!

```{r hist-tree-height-veg-plot}
sst <- rast(
  "data/landsat_casco/b10_cropped/LC08_L2SP_011030_20220909_20220914_02_T1_ST_B10.TIF"
  ) |>
  project(crs(seagrass_casco_2022)) |>
  crop(seagrass_casco_2022)
```

2. We can extract now. Note, some beds will throw an NaN, as 

```{r}
temp_beds <- extract(sst,
                     seagrass_casco_2022,
                     fun = mean,
                     na.rm = TRUE,
                     raw = FALSE)

seagrass_casco_2022 <- cbind(seagrass_casco_2022, temp_beds)
```

3. It's just a `geom_point()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = seagrass_casco_2022) +
  geom_point(aes(x = SST_F_20220909, y = Hectares))
```
