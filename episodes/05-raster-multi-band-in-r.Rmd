## Things You'll Need To Complete This Episode

See the [lesson homepage](.) for detailed information about the software, data, 
and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this 
episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We introduced multi-band raster data in
[an earlier lesson](https://cobalt-casco.github.io/organization-geospatial/01-intro-raster-data). 
This episode explores how to import and plot a multi-band raster in R.

## Getting Started with Multi-Band Data in R

In this episode, the multi-band data that we are working with is imagery 
collected using the
[Landsat 8 Satellite](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-8)
satellite on row 12 path 30 of it's traverse around the planet. Landsat is a series of multispectral satellites with a 30m pixel resolution. This means that each image has multiple wavelengths of light observed - not just Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Here are the bands of the Landsat 8 OLI:

- Band 1 Coastal Aerosol (0.43 - 0.45 µm) 30 m
- Band 2 Blue (0.450 - 0.51 µm) 30 m
- Band 3 Green (0.53 - 0.59 µm) 30 m
- Band 4 Red (0.64 - 0.67 µm) 30 m
- Band 5 Near-Infrared (0.85 - 0.88 µm) 30 m
- Band 6 SWIR 1(1.57 - 1.65 µm) 30 m
- Band 7 SWIR 2 (2.11 - 2.29 µm) 30 m
- Band 8 Panchromatic (PAN) (0.50 - 0.68 µm) 15 m
- Band 9 Cirrus (1.36 - 1.38 µm) 30 m

So, 4, 3, and 2 are RGB. By using the `rast()` function we can read 
one raster bands (i.e. the first one) or many.

Let's start by looking at the red band.

```{r read-single-band}
landsat_band4_1230 <- 
  rast("data/landsat_casco/LC08_L2SP_012030_20230903_20230912_02_T1/LC08_L2SP_012030_20230903_20230912_02_T1_SR_B4.TIF")

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = landsat_band4_1230) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Greys")
```


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge

View the attributes of this band. What are its dimensions, CRS, resolution, min 
and max values, and band number?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r}
landsat_band4_1230
```

Notice that when we look at the attributes of this band, we see:
`dimensions  :  7991, 7891, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)` 

This is R telling us that we read only one band.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Raster Stacks in R

Next, we will work with mutiple bands as an R 
raster object. We will then plot a 3-band composite, or full color, image, and what is called a 'fasle-color' image.

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, we use the`rast()` function.

For multi-layer views, we need to look at all of the files we get with a typical sensor image. They are often listed as different files (although they can come in one big file.) Let's see what a typical Landsat image has.

```{r show-files}
list.files("data/landsat_casco/LC08_L2SP_012030_20230903_20230912_02_T1/")
```

That's a lot of files! To load them in with `rast()` in a single object, thought, we will want only those that are TIF files, and we will need the full path to each one. Fortunately, `list.files()` makes that easy for us.

```{r file-paths}
landsat_files <- 
  list.files("data/landsat_casco/LC08_L2SP_012030_20230903_20230912_02_T1",
             full.names = TRUE,
             pattern = "TIF")

landsat_files
```

Great! We can now load those in smoothly with `rast()`.

```{r read-all-bands}
# load all bands
landsat_all_1230 <- rast(landsat_files)

landsat_all_1230
```

Now we have a very different set of dimensions and names.

`dimensions  : 7991, 7891, 10  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)`

10 bands! To see what is loaded, we can just use `names()`

```{r mutiband-names}
names(landsat_all_1230)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Data Tip

The number of bands associated with a raster's file can also be determined 
using the `describe()` function: syntax is `describe(sources(landsat_all_1230))`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We just want red, green, blue, and near-infrared for now - bands 2 through 5. Note how that corresponds to layers 4 through 7. So we can subset down. 

```{r subset-raster-stack}
landsat_colors_1230 <- subset(landsat_all_1230,
                              subset = 4:7)
```


Let's preview the attributes of our stack object:

```{r}
landsat_colors_1230
```

We can view the attributes of each band in the stack in a single output. For 
example, if we had hundreds of bands, we could specify which band we'd like to 
view attributes for using an index value:

```{r}
landsat_colors_1230[[2]]
```

We can also use the `ggplot` functions to plota histogram of the first (blue) band:

```{r rgb-hist-band1}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = landsat_colors_1230, 
                 aes(x = LC08_L2SP_012030_20230903_20230912_02_T1_SR_B3),
                 bins = 1e4)
```


This tells us that, for example, we might want to cutoff high quantiles when we start to blend colors for an RGB plot.

We can also plot *all* of the bands with either `plot()` or `ggplot()` adding a `facet_wrap(facets = vars(lyr))` call to facet by layer.


```{r plot-lyrs}
#plot(landsat_colors_1230)

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = landsat_colors_1230) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(lyr)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Greys")
```


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge: Making Sense of Single Band Images

Compare the plots of band 4 (red) and band 5 (near infrared). Is the land
darker or lighter in band 4 (the red band) compared to band 5 (near infrared)?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r red-nir, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = landsat_colors_1230[[3:4]]) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(lyr)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_b()
```

We'd expect a *brighter* value for the land in band 5 (NIR) than in band 4 
(red) because healthy vegetation reflects MORE NIR light than red light.

## Create A Three Band Image

To render a final three band, colored image in R, we use the `plotRGB()` or `geom_spatraster_rgb()` function.

This function allows us to:

1. Identify what bands we want to render in the red, green and blue regions. 
   The `plotRGB()` function defaults to a 1=red, 2=green, and 3=blue band 
   order. However, you can define what bands you'd like to plot manually. 
   Manual definition of bands is useful if you have, for example a 
   near-infrared band and want to create a color infrared image.

2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to increase or decrease contrast.

Let's plot our 3-band image. Note that we can use the `plotRGB()` function 
directly with our RasterStack object (we don't need a dataframe as this 
function isn't part of the `ggplot2` package).

```{r plot-rgb-image, eval = FALSE}
plotRGB(landsat_colors_1230,
        r = 3, g = 2, b = 1)
```

That throws an error as sometimes plotRGB doesn't like really large values when it rescales. RGB values for a computer screen are typically between 0 and 255, so, we just need to rescale our values between 0 and 255. We can do that by multiplying the raster values by 255/(max of the raster values). Note, you can either do this so EACH channel is rescalled to 0-255, or, they are all rescaled by one grand value.

```{r plot-rgb-scaled, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
colmax <- max(landsat_colors_1230[[1:3]]) |> values() |> max(na.rm = TRUE)

colmax
    
plotRGB(landsat_colors_1230 * 255/colmax,
        r = 3, g = 2, b = 1, main = "Rescaled for each channel")
```

The image above looks OK, but dark. You can actually play with the denominator of the scaling to make more interesting ones, or scale by other rasters. But, there are more standard (and better) stretching algorithms. We can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using `stretch="lin"` or
`stretch="hist"`.

When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a darker image is 
rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to the full 0-255 
range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/imageStretch_dark.jpg){alt='Image Stretch'}


When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a lighter image is 
rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to the full 0-255 
range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.

![](fig/dc-spatial-raster/imageStretch_light.jpg){alt='Image Stretch light'}


We can implement this easily in R where we not only make a linear stretch, but chop off some of the highest and lowest values.

```{r plot-rgb-lin-stretch}
plotRGB(landsat_colors_1230,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        stretch = "lin")
```

If the problem is that we want an even distribution of values for each channel, rather than clumps and clusters, we use `hist` as our stretch.

```{r plot-rbg-image-linear}
plotRGB(landsat_colors_1230,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        stretch = "hist")
```

In this case, the stretch begins to show some things happening offshore a bit more, which might prompt more investigation. 

Note, to do this with ggplot2, we need to apply `stretch()` to the raster first and cut off the lower and upper quantile of values. We can then use `geom_spatraster_rgb()`. Note, to use `stretch()` and get the RGB right, we need to reference the layer numbers of the raster as indices.

```{r geom_spatraster_rgb, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster_rgb(data = stretch(landsat_colors_1230[[c(3,2,1)]],
                                 minq = 0.02, maxq = 0.98))
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge - False Color Images

What we have plotted above is a True Color Image. To help see things, many people use False color Images. Either they switch the bands (so, GRB instead of RGB) or use other bands. What do you see that is different if you try the following. Apply any stretch you like.

1. Instead of RGB, plot GRB.  
2. Instead of RBG, plot NRG (where N = NIR). This creates a 'vegetation in red' map, which can be useful for vegetation.


:::::::::::::::  solution

## Answers

1) Note how we use r, g, and b as channel 1, 2, and 3.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotRGB(landsat_colors_1230,
        r = 2, g = 3, b = 1,
        stretch = "lin")
```

2) Here if you stretch with hist,you can get a better split between very vegetated and urbanized areas.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotRGB(landsat_colors_1230,
        r = 4, g = 3, b = 2,
        stretch = "hist")
```

## Data Tip

You can create interactive RGB overlays as well. But it takes some extra doing,
as you have to downsample large images, as `geom_spatraster()`
does natively. You can do this with `spatSample()`. `leaflet` currently does odd
things to RGB rasters, so, you should use the `leafem` library. Which does not 
yet handle `SpatRaster` objects from `terra`. Fortunately, it's a small thing to 
convert it to an old school `raster` stack with `raster::stack()` (we're not 
loading the whole library to prevent conflicts in function names). Note, for big
rasters, you can up `maxbytes` in the `addRasterRGB` from it's default of 
`4*1024*1024`, but, this can cause plotting to take a very very very long time.

```{r rgb-raster-leaflet, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(leafem)

# resample and then convert to a raster::stack object
# note, if this raster was small, we wouldn't have to 
# spatSample()
landsat_colors_raster <- landsat_colors_1230 |>
  spatSample(size = 5e5, as.raster = TRUE, method = "regular")|> 
  raster::stack()

# plot using addRasterRGB from leafem
leaflet() |>
  addRasterRGB(x = landsat_colors_raster,
               quantiles = c(0.02, 0.98))
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A single raster file can contain multiple bands or layers.
- Use the `rast()` function to load all bands in a multi-layer raster file into R.
- Individual bands within a SpatRaster can be accessed, analyzed, and visualized using the same functions no matter how many bands it holds.
